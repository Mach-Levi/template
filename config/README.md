## Configurations for your readme template.
I have now made this repository easy to copy after many requests. For configuration, :<br>
* Click the <a href="https://github.com/omololevy/omololevy/generate"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Use_this_template-208b3a?style=for-the-badge&logo=maseno&logoColor=white" alt="template" /></a>&nbsp; button and then select the 1st option, `Create a new repository` to create an instant clone of the repo to your account.
* Let the name of the repository be your github username. You can also chose to give it any name of your choice, depending on where you want to use it.
* Change my github username, `omololevy`, that appears in the README file, to your github username, and my email address, `cotechlevy@gmail.com`, wherever it appears, to your email address. 
* You should consider changing adjusting the  skills and education manually. Other things like used languages, streak and snake will automatically adjust themselves upon aching the github username.
